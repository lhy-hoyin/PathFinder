## Software Engineering Principles
* DRY Principle
* KISS Principle

## Version Control
We used GitHub to host our repository as well as to enforce version control of our code.
We used different branches to concurrently develop on different features of the project.

## Manual Testing
During our development, we did our own testing to ensure that the various features work 
as we had imagined to it. We also testing the features which the other member did and provided
feedback on what we think can be improved on, or and issues we faced when trying the feature.

## User Testing
To have a better idea on how other users would find out application, we created a Google Form which user can fill in. The form clearly indicated various task which the users can completed. Each task has specific steps to tests a certain part of our application. Within the form, testers are provided with the steps to accomplish the task, and can also indicate any issues they faced when trying to complete the task. This allowed us to determined pinpoint whichever part of our application that needed improvement.
